How validation happens with Zod :

1. Define rules with Zod

const step1Schema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().nonempty("First name is required"),
  lastName: z.string().nonempty("Last name is required"),
});

👉 This says:
- firstName must be a non-empty string.
- lastName must be a non-empty string.
- If not, show the error messages.

2. Tell React Hook Form to use Zod

useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(fullSchema),
});

👉'zodResolver' is like a bridge: it connects Zod’s validation rules with React Hook Form’s validation system.

3. When the user clicks "Next" or "Submit"

- trigger(stepFields) → asks RHF to validate just those fields using the Zod schema.
- handleSubmit(onSubmit) → asks RHF to validate all fields using the Zod schema.

4. Zod checks the values

- RHF sends the current form values to Zod.
- Zod checks them against the schema rules.
- If values don’t match → it returns an error message.
- If values match → it returns valid data.

5. Errors go back into React Hook Form

- RHF takes Zod’s error messages and stores them in formState.errors.
- Inside <Controller>, you read fieldState.error.message → and display it below the input.

🧩 Example

Schema rule:
firstName: z.string().nonempty("First name is required")

User input:
{ "firstName": "" }

Zod checks:
→ Empty string ❌ not allowed.
→ Returns { message: "First name is required" }.

RHF shows that message under the input field.

Once user types "John" → Zod says ✅ valid → error disappears.

👉 In one sentence:
Validation works by defining rules in Zod → passing them through zodResolver 
→ React Hook Form checks values against those rules on Next/Submit 
→ errors are shown if rules are broken.
